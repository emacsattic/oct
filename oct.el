(defconst oct-introduction
  "I love the brevity/flexibility of GNU octave.  oct.el implements
\(inefficiently) a *few* common octave functions.  Thus, any of the
arguments to oct-+ can be a number, a vector, or a matrix. 

For oct.el, an example of  row vector is '(1 2 3), a column vector is 
'((1) 
  (2) 
  (3)) 

and a matrix is 
'( (1 2 3)
   (2 3 4))

Each of oct.el's functions, oct-foo seeks to perform the exact same
behavior as that of the corrresponding octave function foo.  Many are
incomplete---i.e. do not handle all possible cases of vectors/matrices
for their arguments.  For documentation on any ocave function, just
\(apt-get) install octave2.1*, fire up octave, and type help foo; also
look at octave info files. 

There's no matrix-multiplication here (yet).  BTW, there was one
matrix.el posted here a few years ago.

If you are not into GNU Octave, probably the only useful function here
might be some utilitiess like oct-corr (correlation) or oct-std
\(standard deviation) --- viz. just apply them to lists. 

Octav is huge, and growing. So, this library will never be complete,
nor am I working currently on it. Which is why i should go ahead and post
whatever I have here. :)  " )

--traditional', and the two do differ in some rare aspects. " )
